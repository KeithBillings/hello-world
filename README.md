# hello-world
My first repository!

I am starting a new journey in my life that I think will soon hold a lot of value! I am learning to code.

Until now I have had a variety of jobs. I have done delivery driving, warehouse forklifting, firefighting, facilites maintenance, and freelance repair work of all sorts. 
I have always been a hands-on, physical person. Now, I am trying my hand at something relatively new. Although, not as new as it may seem. 
I built my first computer when I was 12 years old, and even though most of my jobs were very dirty, there was always some sort of technical thing that I had to learn. I always excelled at that. When I was doing maintenance, I seemed to do more IT work than IT themselves, on top of all the electrical and plumbing issues I was solving. When firefighting, you always have top of the line gear, some of it very cutting edge and technical, so you had to go through training courses to learn these new gadgets. 

These days, coding is everywhere. 
And now, I am going to be a part of it. 

I can't wait, and I hope it takes me far. I am a naturally creative person, my hobbies include photography (I have my own website), resin art, wood working, and cars. Now I get to extend my creativity deeper into the digital world, and I am excited to see where it takes me and what I can make!
